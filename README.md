# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

### Overview

Pewlett Hackard is expecting a significant number of employees to retire within the next few years. This analysis aims to determine the total number of employees likely to retire in the near future, which departments they belong to, and which departments have sufficient eligible employees for a mentorship program for junior employees. To make these determinations I have created the following four tables:

##### Retirement Titles
A list of current retirement eligible employees names, employee numbers, titles, and hire dates.

##### Unique Titles
A more refined list that only includes the current title of retirement eligible employees.

##### Retiring Titles
