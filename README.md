# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

### Overview

Pewlett Hackard is expecting a significant number of employees to retire within the next few years. This analysis aims to determine the total number of employees likely to retire in the near future, which departments they belong to, and which departments have sufficient eligible employees for a mentorship program for junior employees. To make these determinations I have created the following four tables:

##### Retirement Titles
A list of current retirement eligible employees names, employee numbers, titles, and hire dates.

##### Unique Titles
A more refined list that only includes the current title of retirement eligible employees.

##### Retiring Titles
A list of the count of retirement eligible employees from each department.

##### Mentorship Eligibility
A list of employees born in 1965 (the age deemed eligible to enter the mentorship program).

### Results

##### 1.
The departments that will lose the most employees are Senior Engineers, Senior Staff, and Engineers.

##### 2.
Management will be relatively unaffected by the 'silver tsunami' as only two managers are retirement eligible.

##### 3. 
There are 1,940 mentorship eligible employees.

##### 4. 
Of the 300,024 current Pewlett Hackard employees 90,398 are eligibile for retirement (30.13%).
